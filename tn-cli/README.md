# Command Line Client for Tinode

- [Go implementation](#tn-cli-go)

This is a scriptable command line chat client. It's written in Python and can be used to extend Tinode using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) [API](../pbx/).

Python 2.7 or 3.4+ is required. PIP 9.0.1 or newer is required.

Install dependencies:
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the client from the command line:
```
python tn-cli.py --login-basic=alice:alice123
```

If you are updating an existent installation, make sure the `tinode_grpc` version matches the [server](../server/) version. Upgrade `tinode_grpc` if needed:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade tinode_grpc==X.XX.XX
```
where `X.XX.XX` is the version number which must match the server version number.

The client takes optional parameters:

 * `--host` is the address of the gRPC server to connect to; default `localhost:16060`.
 * `--web-host` is the address of Tinode web server, used for file uploads only; default `localhost:6060`.
 * `--ssl` the server requires a secure connection (SSL)
 * `--ssl-host` the domain name to use for SNI if different from the `--host` domain name.
 * `--login-basic` is the `login:password` to be authenticated with.
 * `--login-token` is the token to be authenticated with.
 * `--login-cookie` direct the client to read the token from the cookie file `.tn-cli-cookie` generated during an earlier login.
 * `--no-login` do not login even if cookie file is present; this is the default in non-interactive (scripted) mode.
 * `--no-cookie` do not save cookie on successful login; this is the default in non-interactive (scripted) mode.
 * `--api-key` web API key for file uploads; default `AQEAAAABAAD_rAp4DJh05a1HAwFT3A6K`
 * `--load-macros` path to a macro file.
 * `--verbose` log incoming and outgoing messages as JSON.
 * `--background` start interactive session in background; non-interactive sessions are always started in background.

If multiple `login-XYZ` are provided, `login-cookie` is considered first, then `login-token` then `login-basic`. Authentication with token (and cookie) is much faster than with the username-password pair.

## Commands

Type `<command> -h` for help

See some of these commands in use in the [sample-script.txt](sample-script.txt). Try it as
```
python tn-cli.py < sample-script.txt
```

### Local (non-networking)

* `.await` - issue a gRPC call and wait for completion, optionally assign result to a variable.
* `.delmark` - use custom delete marker instead of default `DEL!`; needed when some value is to be removed rather than set to blank.
* `.exit` - terminate execution and exit the CLI; also `.quit`.
* `.log` - write a value of a variable to `stdout`.
* `.must` - issue a gRPC call and wait for completion, optionally assign result to a variable; raise an exception if result is not a success.
* `.quit` - terminate execution and exit the CLI; also `.exit`.
* `.sleep` - suspend the process for a number of milliseconds.
* `.use` - set default user (on_behalf_of user) or topic.
* `.verbose` - toggle logging verbosity.

### gRPC calls

* `acc` - create  or modify an account
* `login` - authenticate current session
* `sub` - subscribe to topic
* `leave` - detach or unsubscribe from topic
* `pub` - post message to topic
* `get` - query topic for metadata or messages
* `set` - update topic metadata
* `del` - delete message(s), topic, subscription, or user
* `note` - send notification

### HTTP requests

* `upload` - upload file out of band

### Macros

Macros are high-level wrappers for series of gRPC calls. Currently, the following macros are [available](macros.py):

* `chacs` - change default permissions/acs for a user (requires root privileges)
* `chcred` - add or delete a credential for a user (requires root privileges)
* `passwd` - set user's password (requires root privileges)
* `resolve` - resolve login and print the corresponding user id
* `useradd` - create a new user account
* `userdel` - delete user account (requires root privileges)
* `usermod` - modify user account (requires root privileges)
* `thecard` - print user's public and private info (requires root privileges)

You can define your own macros in [macros.py](macros.py) or create a separate python module (you can load it via `--load-macros`).
Refer to [macros.py](macros.py) for examples.

## Connecting to secure (HTTPS) server

If the server is configured to use TLS, i.e. running as `httpS://my-server.example.com/`, the gRPC endpoint also uses the same SSL certificate. In that case add the `--ssl` option.

If you want to connect to the secure gRPC endpoint over a local network or under a different name i.e. as `localhost` instead of  `my-server.example.com` in this example, you must specify the SSL domain name to use, otherwise the server will not be able to find the right SSL certificate:
```
python tn-cli.py --host=localhost:6001 --ssl --ssl-host=my-server.example.com
```
The `--ssl-host` option makes the connection susceptible to the [Man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), so don't do it over public networks.

## Crash on shutdown

Python 3.6 sometimes crashes on shutdown with a message `Fatal Python error: PyImport_GetModuleDict: no module dictionary!`. That happens because Python is buggy: https://bugs.python.org/issue26153


## tn-cli-go

The Go version of Tinode CLI (tn-cli) follows the same rules and commands as described in the Python documentation. This section primarily serves to highlight the tasks completed so far, as the Go implementation is still in progress. 

Either build the binary or use `go run .` in place of `tn-cli`.
```bash
cd tn-cli
go build -o tn-cli .
```

### Usage
```
tn-cli [flags]
tn-cli [command]
```

### Available Commands
- `acc`         Create or alter an account
- `login`       Authenticate current session

### Flags
- `--host string`          address of Tinode gRPC server (default: "localhost:16060")
- `--log_flags string`     comma-separated list of log flags (default: "stdFlags")
- `--login-basic string`   login using basic authentication username:password
- `--verbose`              log full JSON representation of all messages

Use `tn-cli [command] --help` for more information about a command.
